### Class

[CS 294: Deep Reinforcement Learning, Fall 2017](http://rll.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/), Berkeley

#### Guide from Andrej Karpathy

* [Deep Reinforcement Learning: Pong from Pixels](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/) :+1:
* Reading Sutton's book to get the foundations
* Watching some recent talks from John Schulman or Pieter Abbeel (e.g. the recent one from Deep Learning summer school in Montreal is great)
* Implementing DQN/Policy Gradients yourself from scratch.
* Take advantage of OpenAI's gym to get access to the environments. 
* From there it's paper reading and code reading (several recent implementations have popped up in repositories on Github)

> Unfortunately it is the case that in many new areas it can be hard to break in from the outside. So if you were more serious I think you’d want to find a way to collaborate with someone who has much more experience in the area. This is especially the case in RL because there are quite a few of tips/tricks/hacks to advantage functions, baselines, how to set up the experiments, how to debug effectively, etc., and not all of this gets properly serialized to papers. Instead, it’s merely distributed through a common knowledge among the researchers. This doesn’t mean that you can’t break in, it’s just much easier if you can take advantage of 1–1 apprenticeship learning.
